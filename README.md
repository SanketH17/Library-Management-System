# LibraryManagementSystem
Library Management System is developing a computerized system to maintain all the daily work of the library.
       A college library management is a project that manages and stores books information electronically according to students needs. 
       The system helps both students and library manager to keep a constant track of all the books available in the library. 
       It allows both the admin and the student to search for the desired book. 
       It becomes necessary for colleges to keep a continuous check on the books issued and returned and even calculate fine. 
       This task if carried out manually will be tedious and includes chances of mistakes. T
       hese errors are avoided by allowing the system to keep track of information such as issue date, last date to return the book and even fine information 
       and thus there is no need to keep manual track of this information which thereby avoids chances of mistakes.      
       Overall Web-based Library Management System is a project to help the students as well as the staff of the library to maintain the library in the best way possible and 
       also to reduce the human efforts.
